All I can think of myself is how I can think of myself.
Life is made up of such wonderful puzzles;
That are the easiest of all, if you don't try to solve them;
And you become a puzzle yourself;
If you learn to fathom any one of them!
Life is one purest song;
That even night's darkest moments murmur;
And your days vaporize in the vessels,
Formed of the shadows of the future;
If you try to hold it to your soul!
